Public Utilities that provide internet services (& TV & Phone, though not to a similar uptake) to their subscribers exist in a very interesting spot -
while they tend to be funded/backed by the local municipalities and thus enjoy some tax/subsidy benefits, they also compete with larger and more established
players that may be operating in their market viz. Comcast, Charter, Altice and so forth. Therefore, their services tend to be evaluated in the same
breath as someone who perhaps has a billion dollars set aside for [engineering budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_Technology_Center)


As a result, techbnology suppliers tend to service the needs of the larger MSOs while Utilities end up having to navigate a confused mish-mash of resourcdes,
products & technologies that they were never the intended primary target audience for.

Through this blog, we intend to create resources that could help operators choose/decide between various technology options avilable to them. These resources are
intended to be free, but if you wish to contact us - please feel free to fill in the contact form or drop an email to us

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name, greeting):
  return print(f'{greeting}, {name}')

print_hi('Ankush', 'hi')
#prints 'Hi, Ankush' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
